Repo for a little experiment to generate content for instagram and post it using motivational quotes and some AI.  
Its goal is not to seriously create content for instagram to make a channel famous, but rather a little experiement.

## Procedure
### 1. Get a motivational quote
As I am not really creative on a motivational level, it is clear that some quotes have to be generated or copied using external ressources.  
TODO: Get websites matching the criteria (being crawlable) or some word generator that can create usefull sentences.

### 2. Get keywords matching the quote to use further on
Since I do not want to do any more than I have to in the process of actually creating images, some keywords have to be automatically generated using (probably) some kind of AI.
TODO: Get an AI to do the job, probably some BERT variant.

### 3. Get an image that can be used as background for the quote
Using the generated keywords (plus some pre-defined words like "nature"), find an image that can be used.
TODO: Find website that allows easy search using keywords for images with a fitting license.

### 4. Generate the image
Combine image and quote to create an image. Preferably square and readable quote.

### 5. Identify hashtags
Using the quote, the keywords and the image, generate a list of hashtags matching the post.

### 6. Post the result to instagram
Automate the procedure to post it to instagram. Account: **summa*removeme*limetta** (without "removeme")
